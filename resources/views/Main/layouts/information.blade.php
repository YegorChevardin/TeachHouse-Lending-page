					We asked many people why they this occurs,
					and the answer was as expected.
					Many people are taught ONLY English grammar!
					Learning ONLY English grammar is not a good method!
					When you are given the opportunity, maybe even pushed,
					to speak English on a regular basis, your language skills
					will dramatically improve.

					Julia is the one of first students who came to our speaking club.
					When Julia was 15 years old she had difficulties pronouncing
					many English words and this was especially true when she had to speak
					in a group setting.
					She was scared and simply lacked the practice time necessary to improve
					her speaking skills and confidence.
					But after 1 month, she was the best student in our class.
